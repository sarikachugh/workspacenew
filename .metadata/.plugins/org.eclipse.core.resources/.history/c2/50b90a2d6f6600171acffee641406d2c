	<!-- autowire=byType : there is one member variable and single bean with the class type as Point. -->
    <!-- it will not work with multiple member variable or multiple beans of a class -->
 
 autowire=constructor : there is one bean per type, instead of setter injection their
 is constuctor for three different types for eg. and then we have three different beans for
 three diffrent types and spring will instantiate these types and instantiate these beans
 pass it to right types of constructor
 
 default autowire off, manual autowiring for each of references.
